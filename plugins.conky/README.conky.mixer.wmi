wminfo conky.mixer.wmi


The conky.mixer.wmi displays the following information:

    MIXER: VOL: 14
    MIXER: MIX: 80%
    MIXER: ##########
    MIXER: L: 80%
    MIXER: R: 80%

That looks in the wminfo window like:

    +---------+
    |VOL: 14  |
    |MIX: 80% |
    |||||||||||
    |L: 80%   |
    |R: 80%   |
    +---------+

The VOL setting works with IMB/Lenovo ThinkPads only so do not use it if you
owning the other machine.
