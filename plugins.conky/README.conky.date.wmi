wminfo README.conky.date.wmi


The conky.date.wmi plugin displays the following information:

    +---------+
    |16:39:57 |
    |THURSDAY |
    |DEC  01  |
    |WEEK 48  |
    |YEAR 2011|
    +---------+

If you use the localized system and the conky.date.wmi plugin displays
the text ignoring diacritic characters try to run wminfo using the
appropriate encoding and filter the plugin output.  For example the
valid command for the Polish-language system is:

    wminfo -p conky.date.wmi -u 1 -i 2 -b#000000 -f#ffff00

and the valid plugin code looks like:

    #!/bin/bash
    . conky-parser DATE utf8-iso2

That plugin started in the default conky configuration provided with the
wminfo dockable application updates the displayed time every three seconds
because in the default configuration conky updates the information every
three seconds:

    update_interval 3.0

I used such a period in order to save the CPU power.  The conky using the
update interval equal 1.0 uses more power.

Instead of using the conky.date.wmi plugin it is better to use the regular
date.wmi plugin from the plugins.system directory.  If you prefer the
conky.date.wmi plugin nevertheless shorten the conky update interval from
three to one second.

In the default conky configuration the setting for the clock looks like
that:

    DATE: ${time %H:%M:%S}

It displays the hours from 00 to 23.

If you prefer the hours in AM/PM format use the following setting:

    DATE: ${time %I:%M:%S%p}

In the default conky configuration the setting for the week looks like that:

    DATE: ${time week %W}

It assumes the week begins on Monday.

For the week beginning on Sunday use the following setting:

    DATE: ${time week %U}
