To monitor the weather and the weather forecasts for some places all the
time you can use conky.weather.wmi and conky.forecast.wmi or weather.wmi and
forecast.*.wmi plugins -- conky-related plugins use less system resources
than their bash equivalents.  On the other hand if you would like to check
some weather conditions occasionally these plugins are not convenient.  In
such a cases use insted of them the weather- script.

The weather- script displays the current weather and the weather forecast
for the given city.  It uses /usr/local/bin/WeatherLocationDatabase.txt
file.  You will find that file there:

    http://www.radoslavdimov.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-digiclock/WeatherLocationDatabase.txt

In order to use it with the weather- script put it to /usr/local/bin
directory.

The sample entry in the above file looks like:

    City Name = "Wroclaw, PL" Location = "EUR|PL|PL001|WROCLAW" Country = "Poland"

The commands such as:

    weather- Wroclaw

or:

    weather- Wroclaw, PL

display the information such as:

    EUR|PL|PL001|WROCLAW
    Currently in Wroclaw, PL: 33 C and Sunny
    Today: High 32 C: Low 17 C: Mostly sunny and warmer
    Tomorrow: High 27 C: Low 14 C: Partly sunny with a shower

The command:

    weather- Poland

displays the available entries for all the locations in Poland.

                                      *
                                    *   *

Unfortunately some entries in the WeatherLocationDatabase.txt file are
invalid, for example:

    City Name = "Calcutta, IN" Location = "ASI|IN|IN036|CALCUTTA" Country = "India"
    City Name = "Moscow, RU" Location = "ASI|RU|RS052|MOSKVA" Country = "Russia"

As a result the commands such as:

    weather- Calcutta

or:

    weather- Moscow

display the error messages:

    ASI|IN|IN036|CALCUTTA
    weather-: invalid location.

or:

    ASI|RU|RS052|MOSKVA
    weather-: invalid location.

In order to set the valid location codes you have to customize the settings
for those cities:

    City Name = "Kolkata, IN" Location = "ASI|IN|IN036|KOLKATA" Country = "India"
    City Name = "Moscow, RU" Location = "ASI|RU|RS052|MOSCOW" Country = "Russia"

                                      *
                                    *   *

Some other entries does not work for some reason though the location codes
seem to be correct.  For example the command:

    weather- New York

causes the same error message:

    NAM|US|NY|NEW YORK
    weather-: invalid location.

though "NAM|US|NY|NEW YORK" should work well.

In fact almost all locations in United States work bad.

In such a case you should use the zip code.  There are a lot of ways to find
it.  For example you can go to the http://www.accuweather.com website and
enter in ``AccuWeather.com for'' field the value ``New York, NY''.  Then
look at the address bar:

    http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/new-york-ny/10007/weather-forecast/349727

The number 10007 in that example is the zip code for New York.

The other method is to go to http://www.zip-codes.com website, enter the
town or the city name and choose the appropriate zip code.

As a result the command:

    weather- 10007

displays the valid weather information:

    10007
    Currently in New York, NY: 26 C and Sunny
    Today: High 26 C: Low 16 C: Mostly sunny and nice
    Tomorrow: High 23 C: Low 14 C: Partly sunny

You can customize the entry in /usr/local/bin/WeatherLocationDatabase.txt
file as well.  Instead of:

    City Name = "New York, NY, US" Location = "NAM|US|NY|NEW YORK" Country = "United States"

put there:

    City Name = "New York, NY, US" Location = "10007" Country = "United States"

As a result you can use the city name instead of the zip code so the
command:

    weather- New York

displays the result:

    10007
    Currently in New York, NY: 26 C and Sunny
    Today: High 26 C: Low 16 C: Mostly sunny and nice
    Tomorrow: High 23 C: Low 14 C: Partly sunny

                                      *
                                    *   *

Some cities names are ambiguous.  For example the command:

    weather- Ede

displays the result:

    EUR|NL|NL004|EDE AFR|NG|NI000|EDE AFR|CM|CM005|EDÃ‰A AFR|ZA|SF003|EDENBURG
    weather-: invalid location.

In that case there are four cities names starting from ``Ede'':

    Ede, NL
    Ede, NG
    Edea
    Edenburg

To avoid the ambiguity use the following commands:

    weather- Ede, NL

    EUR|NL|NL004|EDE
    Currently in Ede, NL: 15 C and Cloudy
    Today: High 17 C: Low 10 C: A few showers
    Tomorrow: High 19 C: Low 11 C: Cloudy with a passing shower

    weather- Ede, NG

    AFR|NG|NI000|EDE
    weather-: invalid location.

    weather- Edea

    AFR|CM|CM005|EDÃ‰A
    Currently in EdÃ©a, CM: 24 C and Intermittent Clouds
    Today: High 30 C: Low 22 C: A thunderstorm or two
    Tomorrow: High 29 C: Low 22 C: A thunderstorm or two

    weather- Edenburg

    AFR|ZA|SF003|EDENBURG
    Currently in Edenburg, ZA: 6 C and Mostly Cloudy W/ T-Storms
    Today: High 13 C: Low -1 C: Variable clouds with t-storms
    Tomorrow: High 9 C: Low -2 C: Partly sunny and chilly

                                      *
                                    *   *

Some location codes use diacritical characters encoded in ISO-8859-1.  The
weather plugin translates them to UTF-8 encoding in order to display them
properly on the modern consoles.  For example the valid location code for
Zurich is "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÜRICH".

The command:

    weather- Zurich

displays the following information:

    EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÃœRICH
    Currently in ZÃ¼rich, CH: 23 C and Partly Sunny
    Today: High 23 C: Low 12 C: Partly sunny and beautiful
    Tomorrow: High 25 C: Low 14 C: Rather cloudy

You can not use the "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÃœRICH" code in conky.conf file or
forecast.zurich.wmi plugin because the valid code is "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÜRICH".
To set such a code copy it from the WeatherLocationDatabase.txt file and
paste it into conky.conf file or forecast.zurich.wmi plugin.

The other method is to use the weather- script output and the appropriate
filter.  The following commands append the valid location codes for Zurich
to the configuration file and the plugin:

    echo "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÃœRICH" | utf8-iso1 >> conky.conf

or:

    echo "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÃœRICH" | utf8-iso1 >> forecast.zurich.wmi

You should move these codes to the appropriate place inside the
configuration file or the plugin and add to these codes the valid context.

For conky.conf it is:

    FORECAST: ${execi 60 forecast "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÜRICH" today}
    FORECAST: ${execi 60 forecast "EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÜRICH" tomorrow}

and for forecast.zurich.wmi plugin it is:

    Location="EUR|CH|SZ026|ZÜRICH"
