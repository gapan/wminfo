wminfo 4.1.2, 2014-01-02:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added beatclock.wmi plugin -- it displays Swatch Internet Time.
* Added dice.wmi plugin -- it tosses a dice after you click the bottom right
    corner of the application window.
* Added print-hours.wmi, print-minutes.wmi, and print-seconds.wmi plugins --
    they display the large numbers of the hours, minutes, and seconds (you
    may use them as the eccentric clock working in three dockable
    application windows).
* Added print-number script which displays the large two-digit number passed
    to the script as an argument -- it offers two types of the font: block
    or smooth.
* Added print-weekday.wmi plugin -- it displays the large name of the
    weekday and offers two types of the font: block or smooth.
* Added binclock-vertical-13.wmi plugin and old binclock-vertical-13.wmi
    plugin renamed to binclock-vertical-14.wmi one -- the new plugin uses
    the idea similar to binclock-vertical-07.wmi plugin by PTrenholme so
    both these binary clocks have a similar performance.
* Added binclock-horizontal-01.wmi plugin and old binclock-horizontal.wmi
    plugin renamed to binclock-horizontal-02.wmi one -- the new plugin uses
    just 2.70% of the CPU while the old one uses about 6.70% of the CPU.
* Added clock.wmi plugin -- it displays semi-analog clock.
* Added fuzzy-clock.wmi -- it writes the time in plain English.
* Added animated acrobats-1.wmi and acrobats-2.wmi sample plugins (I
    borrowed the acrobat from the Scarecrow's ASCII Art FAQ).  Both these
    plugins display exactly the same animation but they use different
    coding methods.  Version 2 uses more system resources than version 1
    but it is easier to edit.
* Added animated cyclist.wmi sample plugin (I borrowed the cyclist from the
    static ASCII art by Peter E. Bergner).
* Added animated golfer.wmi sample plugin (the golfer is inspired by the
    static ASCII art by jgs).
* Added animated ostrich.wmi sample plugin (I borrowed the ostrich from the
    static ASCII art by Lisa O'Donnell).
* Added animated welcome.wmi sample plugin.
* Added -t, --test, -k, and --kill switches to the online script from
    plugins.offline directory -- they allow to test if Internet connection
    and online script work and kill the sleeping processes if they run
    longer than six minutes.
* Changed execi commands in conky.conf FORECAST entries to texeci ones --
    reason: the execi command locks conky when there is no Internet
    connection causing as a result an empty conky output.
* Rewritten cpumon.wmi plugin uses two times more detailed scale and
    monitors CPU two times more frequently.
* Rewritten iching.wmi plugin -- to display a new hexagram click the bottom
    right corner of the application window.
* Updated conky.forecast.wmi plugin and README.conky.forecast.wmi file.
* Updated conky.netmon.wmi plugin.
* Updated billboard-top10.wmi, currencies-pl-buy.wmi,
    currencies-pl-sell.wmi, kernel-2.4.wmi, kernel-2.6.wmi, spiegel.wmi,
    and wyborcza.wmi plugins from plugins.offline and plugins.online
    directories.
* Updated dziadek.wmi plugin.
* Modified timezone.wmi, forecast.*.wmi, weather.wmi, conky.forecast.wmi,
    and conky.weather.wmi plugins -- aligned the times of the executions
    using regular expressions.
* Modified binclock-vertical-04.wmi plugin and updated some other
    binclock-vertical-*.wmi plugins.
* Modified plugin script -- the script used with -h or --help switch
    displays plugins' descriptions.

* Updated the documentation.


wminfo 4.1.1, 2013-04-15:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Repaired conky.conf file (THINKPAD entries).
* Updated conky.forecast.wmi, conky.weather.wmi, and conky.thinkpad.wmi
    plugins.
* Updated conky.thinkpad.wmi and thinkpad.wmi plugins (both of them sleep
    now for 60 seconds after the resume from the suspend in order to allow
    to charge the battery to at least 6% and avoid the recurrent suspends).
* Updated conky.diskmon.wmi and conky.netmon.wmi plugins.
* Modified counter script (now it accepts only -r and --reset switches).
* Added dziadek.wmi sample plugin.
* Updated mondays-child.wmi sample plugin and the timestring script.
* Updated the documentation.


wminfo 4.1.0, 2013-03-04:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Solved the bugs concerning the missing X11/xpm.h or X11/extensions/shape.h
    header files (see: BUGS file).
* Added the possibility of determine the update period not only in seconds
    but also using a regular expression that matches the time string -- in
    order to switch the first day of the week from Monday to Sunday reset
    the week_starts variable value in regex.c and wminfo.c from "Mon" to
    "Sun" (see: README.regex).
* Added messages.wmi, secure.wmi, and syslog.wmi plugins (they display the
    last ten messages in a reverse order).
* Added wrapper-logfiles.wmi plugin.
* Added iching.wmi plugin, iching.cfg file, iching script, and
    README.iching.wmi file (I Ching -- The Book of Changes).

    (gray) colors sample plugins.
* Added colors.html and colors.jpg files demonstrating different color
    palettes.
* Added conky-1.9.0.patch (that patch is useful for conky 1.9.0 used with
    conky.thinkpad.wmi on ThinkPad T61 or a newer one -- see:
    README.conky.thinkpad.wmi).
* The old conky.patch file renamed to conky-1.8.1.patch (that patch is useful
    for conky 1.8.1 used with conky.xmms2.wmi or conky.thinkpad.wmi plugins
    -- see: README.conky.xmms2.wmi and README.conky.thinkpad.wmi).
* Modified alarm, date-pl, date-us, days, pinboard, stopwatch, timer, and
    timezone scripts.
* Modified cpumon.wmi, sysmon.wmi and conky.sysmon.wmi plugins (they display
    now the total CPU usage for user and system so the results displayed by
    these plugins are 1.41 times higher now than before).
* Modified date.wmi, df.wmi, cpumon.wmi, netmon.wi, sysmon.wmi, traffic.wmi,
    uptime.wmi, and weather.wmi plugins (removed -s 0 switch).

wminfo 4.0.0, 2012-10-31:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* A MESSAGE
* The wminfo 4.0.0 introduces a lot of the changes in the comparison to the
    3.0.0 version.  If you are the old-timer read at least the top of the
    current ChangeLog and install everything anew including the plugins and
    ~/.wminfo/conky.conf.  If you are a newcomer follow the README.1st
    document.
* ENHANCED FEATURES
* Modified wminfo program can run not only shell scripts but also Perl, AWK,
    Ruby etc. scripts as well as binary programs it also do not use the
    temporary file (both modifications by Noam Postavsky aka ntubski).
* Improved program performance -- in the default settings wminfo uses now
    significantly less of the CPU power than the previous version (see:
    README.CPU.usage file from the main directory).
* The -t switch (timing) added to wminfo allows the user to choose the level
    of the responsiveness and the CPU demands of the program -- allowed
    values are: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 (default is 4).
* The directory for the conky configuration file and temporary files used by
    wminfo and the plugins changed to ~/.wminfo/.
* The conky configuration file renamed from .conkyrc to conky.conf.
* The .conky.tmp and .conky.log files renamed to conky.tmp and conky.log.
* Added the the possibility to rerun a plugin manually on demand (to rerun
    any plugin click the lower right corner of the wminfo window).
* The wminfo displays now up to 1023 lines of the text (the previous
    versions displayed 127 lines only).
* Implemented better handling of the invalid commands.
* Implemented better error handling.
* Tuned the colors of wminfo window and wminfo.xpm.
* Added wminfo-conky script which starts the conky daemon using wminfo
    settings or restarts the daemon.
* Added multi-screen plugins: conky.multi-system1.wmi,
    conky.multi-system2.wmi, conky.multi-time.wmi,
    conky.wrapper-sun-moon-tz.wmi, conky.wrapper-weather.wmi,
    wrapper-currencies-pl.wmi, wrapper-date-pinboard.wmi,
    wrapper-date-tz.wmi, wrapper-df.wmi, wrapper-internet-allinone.wmi
    wrapper-sun-moon-tz.wmi, and wrapper-weather.wmi.
* Completely rewritten wminfo.xpm includes now all characters from the
    ISO-8859-[1,2,5] encodings -- that change allowed to get rid of about
    one third of the wminfo.c code (the improvement inspired by Peter
    Trenholme aka PTrenholme).
* New characters' table recognizes upper- and lowercases so the following
    scripts were removed: cp1250-up2low, cp1251-up2low, iso1-up2low,
    iso2-up2low, iso5-up2low, koi8r-up2low, up2low, and utf8-up2low, and the
    following plugins from both plugins.offline and plugins.online
    directories were changed: commentcamarche.wmi, dpreview.wmi,
    kommersant.wmi, spiegel.wmi, tvn24.wmi, and wyborcza.wmi.
* The rewritten conky.forecast.wmi, conky.netmon.wmi, conky.sysmon.wmi,
    conky.thinkpad.wmi, conky.top.wmi (it uses zsh instead of bash),
    conky.uptime.wmi, and conky.weather.wmi as well as biff.wmi,
    date-pl.wmi, date-us.wmi, df.wmi, netmon.wmi, sysmon.wmi, timezone.wmi,
    top.wmi, and uptime.wmi plugins use significantly less of the CPU power
    than the previous versions.
* Added binclock-horizontal.wmi, cpumon.wmi, hexclock.wmi, memory.wmi
    and twitter.wmi plugins.
* conky.audacious.wmi, conky.date.wmi, conky.diskmon.wmi, conky.entropy.wmi,
    conky.filesystem1.wmi, conky.memory.wmi, conky.mixer.wmi, conky.moc.wmi,
    conky.mpd.wmi, conky.swap.wmi, conky.toptime.wmi, conky.wireless.wmi,
    and conky.xmms2.wmi use now conky-parser external function by Peter
    Trenholme.
* Updated conky.conf configuration file.
* Updated weather.wmi plugin accepts METAR reports including temperatures
    with fractional precise.
* Updated weather.wmi and forecast.*.wmi plugins cope with a zero size
    counters used by the conky equivalents.
* Added accuweather and weather-poland scripts.
* The weather script renamed to weather- because the expect package from Tcl
    series uses the script named weather.
* The following converters from the contrib directory were improved:
    iso1-utf8, iso2-utf8, iso5-utf8, utf8-iso1, utf8-iso2, and utf8-iso5 --
    now they convert the entire codepages.
* Removed barely useful or duplicated converters: ISO1, ISO1-ASCII,
    ISO1-UTF8, UTF8, and UTF8-ISO1.
* Updated html-iso1 script and added html-iso2 and html-iso5 scripts convert
    HTML entities to ISO-8859-[1,2,5] encodings.
* Added html.html file using HTML entities and html-iso1.wmi, html-iso2.wmi,
    and html-iso5.wmi plugins testing mentioned above converters.
* Improved wminfo help.
* Individual run-all-*-plugins scripts from all directories replaced by the
    universal run-all-wminfo-plugins script and the symbolic links to it.
* The following plugins are modified in order to work properly with the new
    run-all-wminfo-plugins script: conky.forecast.wmi, conky.weather.wmi,
    twitter.wmi, weather.wmi, and netmon.wmi.
* Added wminfo-benchmark script and README.wminfo-benchmark file to the
    contrib directory; the script checks the CPU usage of the any number of
    wminfo plugins at the same time (co-author of the script -- Noam
    Postavsky aka ntubski).
* Added wminfo-benchmark-extensive script which tests 125 instances of the
   given plugin -- do not test at the same time more than two plugins.
* Added wminfo-benchmark-timings script which tests the allowed timing
    periods.
* Added the dummy check of the retured value that displays the vague
    ``something bad happened here'' error message in order to eliminate the
    compilation warning on some systems.
* Improved the configure script.
* Added plugins.binary directory including binary plugins.
* Added binclock-vertical-01.c, binclock-vertical-02c, and
    binclock-vertical-03.c to plugins.binary directory;
    binclock-vertical-04.wmi, binclock-vertical-05.wmi,
    binclock-vertical-06.wmi, binclock-vertical-07.wmi,
    binclock-vertical-08.wmi, binclock-vertical-09.wmi,
    binclock-vertical-10.wmi, binclock-vertical-11.wmi, and
    binclock-vertical-12.wmi to plugins.system directory; as well as
    binclock-vertical-13.wmi to plugins.sample directory.  All
    binclock-vertical-??.wmi plugins do the same but each uses the different
    algorithm.  Lua plugin number 04 requires Lua interpreter and gawk
    plugin number 06 requires gawk 4.0.0 or newer.
* Added binclock-vertical-01.wmi, binclock-vertical-02.wmi, and
    binclock-vertical-03.wmi command containers for the plugins written in C
    from the binary.plugins directory.
* Added c-empty.c and c-empty.wmi plugins to plugins.binary directory.
* Added Makefile to plugins.binary directory (it allows to compile
    optionally the binary plugins locally prior to the installation of
    wminfo).
* Added sun-moon.wmi plugin that displays sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and
    moonset times as well as the moonphase (the plugin requires solunar
    program patched with the solunar.patch from the plugins.system
    directory; see: http://kevinboone.net/README_solunar.html).
* Added julian-date.wmi plugin (it displays Julian date, Modified Julian
    date, Lilian date, Rata Die, and Mars Sol Date; the plugin requires the
    mentioned above solunar program).
* Added counter script which resets or removes the counters used by
    different plugins.
* Rewritten conky.sysmon.wmi plugin uses by default the correction of the
    CPU usage.
* Updated sysmon.wmi plugin allows to easily enable and disable the CPU
    usage correction and displays the running processes number instead of
    the average load (the average load is displayed by the uptime.wmi
    plugin).
* Updated nasdaq.wmi and slashdot.wmi plugins according to the changes on
    the respective websites.
* Updated slckbuilds.wmi plugin.
* Updated default.wmi and bash-empty.wmi plugins.
* Updated online script from plugins.offline directory.
* Updated plugin script from contrib directory.
* Modified date.wmi plugin.
* Modified weather.wmi plugin displays by default the wind speed in km/h
    instead of m/s.
* Modified conky.thinkpad plugin.
* Modified traffic.wmi plugin.
* Modified pinboard.wmi plugin and pinboard script use now pinboard.cfg file
    instead of .pinboard one.
* The forecast.new_york.wmi plugin renamed to forecast.new-york.wmi one.
* Added full-utf8.html file as well as full-utf8-iso1.wmi,
   full-utf8-iso2.wmi, and full-utf8-iso5.wmi plugins to the samples
   directory.
* The test-01-50.wmi and test-50-01.wmi plugins renamed to test-00-50.wmi
    and test-50-00.wmi, and updated.
* Added a-1913-letter-plugin.wmi plugin which shows how wminfo manages with
    the lines of the text longer than 1023 characters and
    a-1050-line-plugin.wmi plugin which shows how wminfo manages with the
    text longer than 1023 lines.
* Updated and improved the other plugins not mentioned above.
* UPDATED DOCUMENTATION
* Updated most of the documents.
* The seaparate README.CPU.conky.usage and README.CPU.usage files replaced by
  the global README.CPU.usage file.
* Added THANKS file.
* Added README.multi+wrapper file.
* Updated man wminfo.
* Added README.1st.plugins.binary to plugins.binary directory.
* Added README.binclock-vertical-x files to both plugins.binary and
  plugins.system directories.
* Added README.sun-moon.wmi file.
* Removed README.Privacy -- now your files privacy is the same as the
    privacy of your $HOME directory.
* OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
* The source file ``doc'' directory renamed to the ``man'' one.
* The program tested in Slackware Linux 13.37 and Linux Mint 13 Maya.


wminfo 3.0.0, 2012-06-24:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* QUICK START
* Added README.1st file for the quick start.
* Updated run-all-conky-plugins script offers the help when the conky is not
    configured properly or conky daemon does not work.
* SOLVED BUGS
* Added the information how to avoid all encountered so far bugs (see: BUGS
    file).
* IMPROVED COMPATIBILITY
* Updated wminfo runs now the plugins using bash instead of sh -- as a
    result it works quietly with the systems which links /bin/sh to the
    other shell than bash (for example Linux Mint links /bin/sh to dash).
* The scripts forecast, netmon, sysmon, and traffic moved to the contrib
    directory -- during the installation of wminfo they are copied to the
    directory registered in the PATH variable in order to work well during
    the tests of the plugins on the systems which do not include the current
    directory in the PATH variable.
* Updated conky.conf file works better on different machines using different
    systems.  Some entries are commented by default because they work bad
    when the appropriate daemon or program does not work in the system.
    Among the commented entries are all related to IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads
    because they abort the conky daemon on the machines other than
    ThinkPads.
* ENHANCED FEATURES
* Added conky.audacious.wmi, conky.diskmon.wmi, conky.entropy.wmi,
    conky.filesystem1.wmi, conky.forecast.wmi, conky.memory.wmi,
    conky.mixer.wmi, conky.mpd.wmi, conky.swap.wmi, conky.topmem.wmi,
    conky.toptime.wmi, and conky.xmms2.wmi plugins.
* Entirely rewritten conky.weather.wmi plugin as well as the corresponding
    conky.conf settings and README.conky.weather.wmi file -- now it is easy
    to add to the configuration file a few weather entries for different
    locations and use a few wminfo instances to monitor the weather in those
    places (see also: BUGS file).
* Updated conky.thinkpad.wmi and thinkpad.wmi plugins -- now they recognize
    IBM/Lenovo ThinkPads.
* Updated conky.timezone.wmi plugin recognizes properly the dates for the
    locations near the International Date Line.
* Updated all conky-related plugins work well even if conky does not provide
    the data for a while.  (The conky 1.9.0 is less responsive than the conky
    1.8.1.)
* Updated most of the plugins from plugins.online and plugins.offline
    directories to work stable when the Internet connection or the monitored
    file are not accessible for a while.
* Added forecast.new_york.wmi, forecast.sydney.wmi, and forecast.wroclaw.wmi
    plugins as well as README.forecast.xxx.wmi file.
* Added days.wmi plugin, days.cfg file, days script, and README.days.wmi
    file -- the plugin counts the number of the days since the given date or
    until the given date.
* Modified timezone.wmi plugin (removed minutes backup because it worked bad
    at the turn of an hour and added the correct date recognition for the
    locations that lie near the International Date Line -- my kind regards
    to all Linux users from Kiribati and Niue).
* Updated biff.wmi plugin recognizes properly non-existing mailbox.
* Updated netmon.wmi and traffic.wmi plugins check eth0, eth1, wlan0, and
    wlan1 interfaces.
* Updated alarm, date-pl, date-us, days, pinboard, stopwatch, timer, and
    timezone scripts accept pico, elvis, and vi editors (the default order
    of editors is: mcedit, nano, pico, elvis, vim, and vi).
* Updated plugin script (now it accepts a few arguments and started with -a
    or --all parameter displays the recommended default commands for all
    plugins installed in /usr/local/bin directory).
* Updated time+date script (now it displays by default just the data for the
    given time zone -- to display the local time as well use at the end of
    the command one of the following switches: -l or --local).
* Added weather script that displays weather information using
    /usr/local/bin/WeatherLocationDatabase.txt file (see the script for
    the Internet location of the above file -- some of the locations stored
    in that file are invalid so you have to correct them yourself).
* Added ISO1, UTF8, ISO1-ASCII, ISO1-UTF8, UTF8-ISO1, dos-unix, and
    macos-unix scripts.
* BETTER DOCUMENTATION
* Added README.2nd.plugins.conky, README.conky.diskmon.wmi,
    README.conky.filesystem.wmi, README.conky.forecast.wmi,
    README.conky.mixer.wmi, README.conky.mpd.wmi, and README.conky.xmms2.wmi
    files.
* Added README.plugin, README.time+date, and README.weather files to the
    contrib directory.
* Added README.Colors file discusses an useful color palette based on the
    Granger rainbow chart.
* Updated README.date.wmi, README.date-xx.wmi, README.netmon.wmi, and
    README.sysmon.wmi files.
* Updated README.timezone.wmi and README.conky.timezone.wmi files reflect
    the changes made in timezone.wmi and conky.timezone.wmi plugins as well
    as in the related configuration files.
* Updated README.Privacy file.
* Updated README.CPU.usage and README.CPU.conky.usage files.
* Updated manual page man wminfo and the main README file.
* Minor updates in the other documents.
* OTHER CHANGES
* The weather.wmi and the conky.weather.wmi plugins use the common counter
    file.  The forecast.*.wmi and the conky.forecast.wmi plugins use the
    common counter file too.  So do not run them at the same time or modify
    them in order to use the separate counter files.
* Modified biff.wmi, uptime.wmi, conky.moc.wmi, and conky.uptime.wmi plugins
    as well as run-all-system-plugins and run-all-conky-plugins scripts
    (changed the default color schemes).
* Updated date.wmi, date-pl.wmi, and date-us.wmi plugins.
* Updated slackware-patches.wmi plugin.
* Updated tvn24.wmi plugin according to the changes on the respective site.
* Updated all currencies-pl-*.wmi plugins according to the changes on the
    respective site.
* The script run-all-internet-plugins from plugins.offline directory renamed
    to run-all-offline-plugins and the script run-all-internet-plugins from
    plugins.online directory renamed to run-all-online-plugins.
* Updated conky.patch file allows to compile conky with XMMS2 support.  The
    patch is designed for conky 1.8.1 -- it seems conky 1.9.0 provides the
    valid data for both conky.thinkpad.wmi and conky.xmms2.wmi plugins so
    instead of patching the old conky version it is better to install the
    new one without that patch.


wminfo 2.6.0, 2012-05-23:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The rewritten timezone.wmi plugin and timezone.cfg* configuration files
    work much better than their predecessors.  Old plugins and the
    accompanying configuration files were complicated and worked bad.
    Before the update remove old timezone.wmi* plugins and timezone.cfg*
    files.
* The rewritten README.timezone.wmi describes the new plugin and the new
    configuration files.

    directories.

    directory -- the last one uses now the new website's address:
    http://dockapps.windowmaker.org/.

    plugins.online directories as well as run-all-system-plugins script from
    plugins.system directory.

    plugin are disabled by default (see: BUGS file).
* Updated verbose switch of wminfo.

    conky bugs and the third one is shared by some other dockable
    applications too).


wminfo 2.5.3, 2012-05-15:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Modified date-us.wmi and date-pl.wmi plugins as well as date-pl.cfg file
    -- the new date-pl.wmi plugin uses about 1.2% less of the CPU power than
    the previous version.
* Modified weather.wmi plugin uses 1% less of the CPU power than the
    previous version (new median 3.0%; old median 4.0%) but still 1.7% more
    of the CPU power than conky.weather.wmi plugin (median 1.3%).
* Modified conky.weather.wmi and the corresponding README file.

    in order to display the proper CPU usage bar.
