wminfo INSTALL


Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Root access if you want to install the program system-wide.


Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  tar xzf wminfo-4.3.0.tar.gz
  cd wminfo-4.3.0/wminfo
  ./configure
  make
  su -
  killall wminfo           # if an old version of wminfo is running
  make install

The ./configure command prepares Makefile installing wminfo in /usr/local
directory.  To install it in /usr directory use ./configure --prefix=/usr
command.

All options controlled by the program switches are collected at the
beginning of wminfo.c file for easy modifications if required.  So if you
would like to change the default behavior of wminfo modify those variables
before the compilation and installation of the program.


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the installation go to /usr/local/doc/wminfo-4.3.0 or
/usr/doc/wminfo-4.3.0 directory depending on the installation method and try
the plugins from plugins.binary, plugins.conky, plugins.online, and
plugins.system-* directories.  To test them use the run-all-wminfo-plugins
script from the respective directories.

You can also test wminfo running plugins from contrib and samples
directories using the respective run-all-wminfo-plugins script.

After the tests you can kill all wminfo instances running killall wminfo
command.

Instead of the plugins from plugins.online directory you can use the plugins
from plugins.offline directory.  The latter do not require the constant
Internet access but some system customization is necessary in order to use
them -- it is described in README.1st file.

To use the particular plugins system-wide copy them to /usr/local/bin
directory.  Some plugins use scripts or text files.  Copy them together with
the plugins.  Sample plugin named plugin.wmi can use the script named plugin
and the text file named plugin.cfg.

To use the plugins from plugins.offline directory copy them as well as
online script to /usr/local/bin directory and register it in crontab.

The directories with the plugins include useful README.* files.  Read them
if you want to know more.

To run wminfo use the following commands:

  wminfo -h                # displays brief help
  wminfo -p plugin.wmi     # runs a plugin

Each plugin includes a comment with the recommended command to run it
including: update time, ISO encoding, and background and foreground colors.
The run-all-wminfo-plugins scripts use these comments to run the respective
plugins.

You can display the recommended commands for all the plugins copied to
/usr/local/bin directory using the command plugin -a or plugin --all or
display the descriptions of the plugins using the command plugin -h or
plugin --help.

For more information see: man wminfo.


Deinstallation

  make uninstall
