* Different (smaller) font support.


TODO list by Cezary M. Kruk <c.kruk@bigfoot.com>       (Sep 21, 2011):

* Add more diacritics to the existing encodings -- especially ISO-8859-2 --
  and add new ISO encodings.  To do that I need your help.  If you want
  wminfo to accept diacritics or letters specific for your language send me
  the sentence encoded in UTF-8 that contain all these letters.  I do not
  expect you to invent such a sentence but to find the already existing
  sentence for your language.  You can send it to Markus Kuhn too.  Here is
  the list of the sentences collected by him:

  The wminfo program can interpret the texts encoded in ISO encodings that
  is characters fitting the ASCII range from 32 to 255.  So I can implement
  the characters specific for your language if there exist the suitable ISO
  encoding.
