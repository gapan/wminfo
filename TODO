TODO list by Cezary M. Kruk <c.kruk@bigfoot.com>       (Oct 22, 2012):

  Add more ISO encodings -- to do that I need your encouragement and your
  cooperation in the case of the languages which use the alphabets other
  than Latin, Cyrillic, or Greek.  The designing of the characters is time
  consuming so I would like to know that at least one person will use the
  results of my work.

  The wminfo program can interpret the texts encoded in ISO encodings that
  is characters fitting the ASCII range from 32 to 255.  So I can implement
  the characters specific for your language if there exist the suitable ISO
  encoding.

  If you want to see the sample of text in your language put into
  quick-utf8.html file from samples directory send me the sentence encoded
  in UTF-8 that contain all diacritics and special letters specific for your
  language.  I do not expect you to invent such a sentence but to find the
  already existing sentence for your language.  You can send it to Markus
  Kuhn too.  Here is the list of the sentences collected by him:
