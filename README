Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
wminfo is a dockapp that displays text-format information using the plugin.
The standard plugin is a shell script.  The plugin writes the information to
stdout and wminfo captures the output and displays it row by row.  Using the
appropriate plugins wminfo can display different information got from the
system or from Internet.


Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To display help run the command:

    wminfo -h

To use the plugin run the command:

    wminfo -p plugin.wmi

A lot of plugins are included in the tarball plugins.* and samples
directories.

Note that the plugins do not need to have the extension wmi and need not to
be the shell scripts.

On the other hand it is easier to write and test shell scripts without
running wminfo and it is convenient to use wmi extension to distiguish
wminfo plugins from the other scripts.

    +---------+
    |DOWN^ ALL|
    |    ^    |
    |   ONE   |
    |    v    |
    |UP  v    |
    +---------+

To activate or deactivate the scrolling of the line of the text click that
line in the middle (position ONE).

To activate or deactivate the scrolling of all lines click the upper right
corner of the application window (positon ALL).

To rewind the text down or up click the upper (DOWN) or the lower (UP) left
corner of the application window.  Rewinding of the text is also possible
with the mouse scroll wheel.

The wminfo program can display the lines of the text up to 1037 characters
in a line.

When the number of the characters is bigger than 1037 and smaller than or
equal 1048 wminfo displays empty application window.

When the number of the characters is equal to 1049 wminfo displays the
message:

    ERROR: plugin out-file () not found.

When the number of the characters is equal to or bigger than 1050 wminfo
displays the message:

    Segmentation fault

To check the lengths of the lines it is enough to redirect wminfo plugin
output:

    plugin.wmi > file.tmp

Each wminfo instance uses most of the time 0.06% of CPU and X Window running
wminfo uses 0.14% of CPU per instance (that is the average for Intel(R)
Core(TM) Duo CPU L2400 @ 1.66GHz).  The CPU usage increases when wminfo
updates the information or scrolls the text.
